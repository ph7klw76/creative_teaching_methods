Problem-based learning (PBL) in university-level physics offers a transformative experience when grounded in real-world relevance and interdisciplinary depth. This module (attached in pdf) blends quantum physics, photonics, and materials science within a condensed matter physics course to challenge students meaningfully.

The learning begins with a fictional but realistic case: Helio Innovations, a renewable energy company, has developed a solar panel using polymer-embedded quantum dots called “HelioDots.” These nanocrystals are engineered to absorb blue-green sunlight and re-emit light sharply at 700 nm, directing it to solar cells optimized for that wavelength. In theory, the quantum confinement effects should yield high efficiency with a narrow emission spectrum. In practice, however, the device underperforms, showing broad emission, low quantum yield, and thermal instability. Batch inconsistencies further complicate performance.

In a 2-hour class session, students are introduced to the case as physics consultants tasked with diagnosing the problem. A handout (attached in pdf)  presents the scenario, key optical and materials challenges, and technical concepts from quantum mechanics and condensed matter physics. This is best done after the fundamental content of the lecture has been covered, the instructor encourages students to identify what they already understand and what they need to investigate.

Throughout the week, students independently explore the underlying physics. They use textbooks, curated online resources and lecture notes to understand the possible failure mechanisms ranging from quantum dot size distribution and surface defects to non-radiative recombination and thermal effects. Students analyze and interpret the scenario, eventually organizing their findings into a consulting-style report or class presentation.

The instructor provides feedback and improvement not just the technical accuracy but also the quality of reasoning, analysis, and creativity. By tackling authentic challenges like the HelioDot case, students shift from passive content absorption to active, interdisciplinary problem-solving. This one-week PBL module can deepen learning outcomes than many weeks of traditional lecture, helping students see physics as a practical tool to address real-world issues.
