Teaching very hard topics like advanced quantum mechanics or its applications in materials often feels like watching students run into an invisible wall. You give them a challenging problem, they stare at it, produce almost nothing, and you can see their confidence drop. You try again with a different question, and the result is the same. After a while, it is easy for both teacher and student to conclude, “Maybe they’re just not cut out for this.” But there’s another way to understand what’s happening: it might not be the students that are broken—it might be the learning environment.

A recent AI paper from MIT describes a similar problem, but with computer models instead of humans. When the model is given tasks that are far too hard, it gets almost everything wrong. Because it rarely succeeds, it never receives a useful “signal” about what works, so it cannot improve. The authors call this being beyond the “edge of learnability.” From the outside, the model looks “bad at reasoning,” but the deeper truth is that it is stuck in a place where learning has nothing to latch onto. That idea transfers beautifully to teaching real students. When we ask learners to do things that are far beyond their current level, they also get stuck at zero. At that point, more struggle does not automatically mean more learning. It just means more frustration.

## The AI Analogy: Teacher-Student Models

The clever move in that AI work is how they change the role of the teacher. Instead of only trying to make the student solve harder and harder problems, they split one model into two roles: a student model that tries to solve the real, difficult target tasks, and a teacher model that generates practice problems. The teacher is not rewarded for making clever or creative questions, and it is not rewarded for how “beautiful” or “realistic” the questions look. It is rewarded only when the student improves on a fixed set of evaluation problems that represent the real goal. Over time, the teacher discovers that the most effective problems are intermediate ones: questions that are not trivial, but not impossible either; tasks that sit just inside the student’s current ability, so that every attempt produces some useful feedback for learning.

## Applying This Insight to Teaching Physics

This is exactly the insight that can transform the way we teach advanced physics topics. Instead of thinking “students just can’t do quantum mechanics,” we can ask a more constructive question: “Have I given them a staircase to climb, or just a sheer cliff?” In practice, this means rethinking how we design problems, how we use tests, and what we pay attention to as teachers.

### Defining Success in Quantum Courses

A good starting point is to decide very clearly what “success” actually looks like in your course. For advanced quantum mechanics or quantum ideas in materials, that does not just mean “can they survive a long algebraic derivation.” It might mean: can they correctly set up the Schrödinger equation for a simple system; can they explain qualitatively what tunneling is and how things like barrier height and width affect it; can they read a simple band structure diagram and say something meaningful about electron motion or whether a material behaves like a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. These kinds of tasks form your “fixed reality check”—a small set of representative problems or questions that capture the real abilities you want your students to walk away with.

### The “Baseline” Test

Early in the topic, you can give a short, low-stakes “baseline” test using some of these tasks. You make it clear to students that this is not about grading them, but about understanding where the class is starting. The results will usually show a familiar pattern. Some things they can already handle. Some things they can partly do—they might start correctly but get stuck in the middle. Other things they cannot do at all: they leave them blank, or they plug random formulas that have nothing to do with the question. That last category is your “stuck at zero” zone, the place where the current way of teaching is not producing any learning signal.

## Diagnosing Failure Points

The next step is to look at a typical hard problem and pinpoint the exact moment where most students fall apart. Think of a standard tunneling problem, for example. One student might already fail at the level of drawing the potential and labeling the regions where the particle is classically allowed or forbidden. Another might get that far but then fail to write down the correct form of the wavefunction in each region. Someone else might handle both, but then completely misunderstand the boundary conditions or the physical meaning of the solution. Each of these is a different failure point, and each tells you something very specific about what is missing. Your job as a teacher becomes less “explain quantum mechanics again from the top” and more “find the first step where this stops being learnable.”

### Designing Intermediate Tasks

Once you know those breaking points, you can design intermediate or “stepping-stone” problems that live just inside students’ current capability. Take that tunneling example. Instead of immediately asking them to calculate a full transmission probability formula and interpret it, you might spend time on tasks where the only goal is to sketch the potential as a function of position, mark the particle’s energy, and shade the classically allowed and forbidden regions. Another set of tasks might focus purely on writing the general wavefunction form in each region, without solving for coefficients. A separate exercise might ask only for the boundary conditions at the interfaces, together with a short, plain-language explanation of what each condition means physically. Yet another might ask them to reason qualitatively: if the barrier becomes wider, does tunneling become more or less likely, and why?

None of these tasks is a “toy” or a distraction. Each one isolates a piece of reasoning that is necessary to solve the full problem. Together, they form a staircase of skills. Students start to experience something crucial: they may not be able to do everything yet, but they can do something meaningful. They can at least draw and label correctly, or they can at least get the structure of the wavefunction. That partial success creates the learning signal the brain needs. The same logic works when you teach band structure or quantum ideas in materials. Before expecting students to analyze a full band diagram and predict transport, you can ask them to identify where the bands are flat or curved, connect curvature to effective mass, or explain qualitatively why a band gap matters for conduction. Each of these is an intermediate step on the way to deep understanding.

## Rethinking Classroom Practice

Class time then shifts in a subtle but important way. Instead of spending most of the lecture deriving the most general solution on the board, you offer a short, focused explanation of the core idea, and then let students work through carefully chosen intermediate tasks, in small groups or individually. As they work, you listen, give small hints, and watch where they struggle. When you regroup as a whole class, you discuss not only the final answers but also the reasoning behind sketches, boundary conditions, or qualitative explanations. Homework can mirror this structure: a mix of stepping-stone exercises and a smaller number of full, challenging problems. Students are not shielded from difficulty; they are given a path into it.

### Testing for Progress

After a week or two of working this way, you return to some of your original “success tasks” and ask students to try again. In many cases, you will see that more students now know how to start, fewer leave things blank, and their explanations are clearer, even if some details are still rough. That is your feedback as a teacher. It tells you that your staircase of intermediate tasks is working. If you do not see much change, that is also valuable information. It suggests that the steps you designed were not the right ones, and that you might need different intermediate problems, or more time on certain subskills. The key is that you are no longer guessing in the dark. You have a concrete way to test whether your teaching is moving students closer to the real goals.

## Redefining Difficulty

This way of thinking changes how we interpret difficulty. When students are stuck at zero on a task, it is no longer automatically a sign that they lack talent or are “not meant for physics.” Often, it is a sign the task is sitting too far beyond their current edge of learnability. When we build stepping stones, we do not water down physics or turn it into something trivial. We respect the full complexity of the subject while respecting how human beings actually learn. Students still feel challenged, but they also feel progress. They begin to say things like, “I can’t do everything yet, but at least now I know how to set things up,” which is a fundamentally different psychological experience from “I have no idea what’s going on.”

## Generalizing Beyond Physics

Although this blog has focused on advanced quantum mechanics and materials, the same pattern applies almost anywhere in the curriculum. You identify what genuine success looks like. You check honestly where students are now. You locate the step where they first fall apart. You design tasks that train that specific step. You let them practice those steps in class and in homework. Then you come back to the original goals and see whether anything has changed. That loop—define, diagnose, design, test, refine—is the teaching version of what that MIT paper did for AI models. It is not about making physics easy. It is about making learning possible.
