# Background

Leveraging interactive YouTube videos as a teaching tool can help students develop critical-thinking skills in physics, particularly in identifying misinformation and disinformation related to fundamental laws, such as over-unity or "free energy" claims.

YouTube’s accessibility and visual demonstrations make it a valuable learning platform, but the open nature of its content requires careful evaluation of sources, credibility, and scientific accuracy. Students should assess the credentials of video creators, identify red flags like unsupported claims and conspiracy rhetoric, and cross-reference multiple sources to ensure consistency with established physics principles.

Interactive activities such as:

- Peer-review discussions  
- Claim-versus-reality assignments  
- Debate sessions  

encourage analytical thinking by requiring students to evaluate evidence, scrutinize data, and apply fundamental laws like **energy conservation** and **thermodynamics**.

Educators can guide students toward high-quality resources, such as:

- Peer-reviewed journals  
- Institutional platforms like [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/)  
- Reputable science channels  

This reinforces the importance of **verifiable claims**.

By integrating YouTube videos into structured lessons, students learn to approach scientific content with skepticism, fostering **scientific literacy** and a deeper understanding of physics through rational analysis and **evidence-based reasoning**.

# Methodology

This step-by-step tutorial demonstrates how to integrate interactive videos into your **UMspectrum** for teaching purposes:

1.	Log in Umspectrum and click Add an activity or resource and select Interactive Content
