# Lab analysis

Before automation of measurement and developing AI controlled system for measurement,
analysis of data can be easily carried out by AI limited by the amount of data you can uploaded in the system.

For example

example
```text
Based on the attached data, do a non-linear regression to find the parameters and its uncertaity. This is a damped pendulum oscillation
```

```text
plot the graph along with best fitted line along the data with annotated equations with parameters
```

## AI assisted Classical Machine Learning

AI is now so powerful that given the data it can run  classical machine learning on complex data.

```text
Run a machine learning analysis based on the data and write a short report describing the correlation
```

The data is coming from a 2018 paper [here] (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.orgel.2018.09.029) and in 2026, chatgpt 5.2 Extended thinking can analyze the data given in the supplementary  information based on

```text
plot all relevant graphs to illustate the above so that it is clear
```

It fails  to reproduce the more challenging contour plot in the paper that requires deeper understanding of domain field.

```text
based on above data and analysis plot :"Contour plot showing the relation between triplet energy of HTL and ETL with device efficiency with EML triplet energy is fixed at 2.60, 2.80, 3.00 eV respectively. So three separate contopur plots . Use the ML (Random Forest) Predicted  (cd/A) to interpolate the data so that it can produce such plots"
